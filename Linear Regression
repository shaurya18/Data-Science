> What is regression analysis ?

  Linear Regression
    -> linear nature which means as the value of X axis data points increases, value of Y axis data points also increases
    -> directly proportional 
    
    Simple Linear Regression - refers to single factor dependency i.e. 1 independent variable only
      Y = m X1 + c 
      c = intercept
      m = slope
    
    Multiple Linear Regression - refers to multiple factors dependency i.e. multiple independent variable only
      Y = m1 X1 + m2 X2 + .... + mn Xn + c

  Regression is based on independent and dependent variables. With the help of regression, we can find out the value of Y (dependent variable as its value depends on X1,X2,X3) as   per the value of independent variables. Essentially, we try to find a relation between these dependent and independent variable.

  Linear Regression can only be used if the dependent variable (output variable) is CONTINOUS and NUMERICAL

  Example: Predicting annual sales for a firm

    Y : independent variable = annual sales
    X1: dependent variable = factors that may impact = employee count 
    X2: dependent variable = factors that may impact = profit
    X3: dependent variable = factors that may impact = loss

    Y = a X1 + b X2 + c X3 
    a = b = c = Coefficient of regression = (thesse are the numbers which define the importance of that particular feature; Higher the value of coeeficient, more will be the value change/strong support/imapct on the dependent variable)

  Logistic Regression - BINARY CLASSIFICATION 
      
    Logistic rergression is used when dependent variable is categorical type
  
    Sigmoid function = Y = 1/ 1 - e^-x ==> Trying to convert independent variable into expression of probability WRT to dependent variabel (range 0-1)
    
    eg. fraud detection, disease detection 
    
     Data points should be free of missing points
     30-50 data points for each class = total - 60-100 data points
