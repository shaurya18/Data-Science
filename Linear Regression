> What is regression analysis ?

  Linear Regression
    -> linear nature which means as the value of X axis data points increases, value of Y axis data points also increases
    -> directly proportional 
    
    Objective = To find out the best fit line among these data points
    
    Simple Linear Regression - refers to single factor dependency i.e. 1 independent variable only
      Y = m X1 + c 
      c = intercept/ constant
      m = slope - it helps to identify what is the change in Y when we change the value of X
        
      How to identify the best line among different lines  -
       If there are multiple lines, then find out the distance of points to the line (error) and then add all the errors. The best line would be the line which has least error.
     
    
    Multiple Linear Regression - refers to multiple factors dependency i.e. multiple independent variable only
      Y = m1 X1 + m2 X2 + .... + mn Xn + c




  Regression is based on independent and dependent variables. With the help of regression, we can find out the value of Y (dependent variable as its value depends on X1,X2,X3) as   per the value of independent variables. Essentially, we try to find a relation between these dependent and independent variable.

  Linear Regression can only be used if the dependent variable (output variable) is CONTINOUS and NUMERICAL

  Example: Predicting annual sales for a firm

    Y : independent variable = annual sales
    X1: dependent variable = factors that may impact = employee count 
    X2: dependent variable = factors that may impact = profit
    X3: dependent variable = factors that may impact = loss

    Y = a X1 + b X2 + c X3 
    a = b = c = Coefficient of regression = (these are the numbers which define the importance of that particular feature; Higher the value of coeeficient, more will be the value change/strong support/imapct on the dependent variable)

  Logistic Regression - BINARY CLASSIFICATION 
      
    Logistic rergression is used when dependent variable is categorical type
  
    Sigmoid function = Y = 1/ 1 - e^-x ==> Trying to convert independent variable into expression of probability WRT to dependent variabel (range 0-1)
    
    eg. fraud detection, disease detection 
    
     Data points should be free of missing points
     30-50 data points for each class = total - 60-100 data points 
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
Regularisation
  
  Y = m1 X1 + m2 X2 + .... + mn Xn + c
  
  Let's say mn=45 then this will be very computationally expensive as it would perform multiplication for each record.
  To reduce the complexity of the model and scale down/shrink the magnitude of the value Mn (regression coefficient), we use regularisation techniques
  

Ridge Regression 
  
  Ridge = Loss + P ||w||^2
  
    Loss = difference between the actual and predicted value
    
    penalty = compensation of the loss' used to reduce the loss (by inducing the penalty here)
    
      P = constant 
      w = coefficient 
        || || - means sum of all the squared value of the coefficients 
      || w ||^2 = w1^2 + w2^2 + w3^2 + w4^2 + w5^2 +.....+ wn^2
   
   
  Lasso = Loss + P ||w||
        
        || w || = w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5 +.....+ wn
        
        Magnitude of coeeficient can be exactly 0
        
        Can also be used for feature selection as some of the features can be dropped becasue coefficients can become 0 
        



Polynomial Regression 

  Linear Regression can be used for prediciton in linear datasets, however linear regression cannot be applied on the non-linear datasets directly it has to be modified
